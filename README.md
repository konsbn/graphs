# graphs
>A simple introduction to beautiful graphs, plotting, ipython and markdown
This notebook emerges as an appreciation for beautiful mathematical figures and as a way to get started with markdown and IPython Notebooks.
This mostly for my personal edification however *math is beautiful* so everyone is invited.
I have used $$\LaTex$$ for entering mathematics. [Markdown] for writing.
Plotting has been done entirely using the [Matplotlib].
